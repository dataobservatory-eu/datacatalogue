## Music concepts {.unnumbered}

| Term | Description |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `audio recording` | fixation of sounds [@iso_isrc_2019] |
| `work` | distinct, abstract creation of the mind whose existence is revealed through one or more expressions (e.g. a performance) or manifestations (e.g. an object) [@iso_iswc_2022] |
| `musical work` | composed of a combination of sounds, with or without accompanying text [@iso_iswc_2022] |
| `music video recording` | fixation of sounds synchronized with pictures or moving pictures where (a) the fixed sounds are wholly or substantially a musical performance or (b) the *recording* is intended for viewing in association with a recording of a musical performance. This definition includes music videos and concert recordings, together with music-related interviews and documentaries, but does not extend to genera! audiovisual material, even if it includes music.[@iso_isrc_2019] |
| `DSP` or `digital streaming platform` | Digital service providers (DSPs), or Digital Streaming Platforms are companies or organisations that provide access to services online. DSPs can provide access to music downloads, like Apple's iTunes Store, or access to streaming music like Spotify, or even provide satellite-delivered content such as SiriusXM in the USA. |
| `rights management (organisations)` | the function of managing the rights on behalf of rights owners. It can be companies whose sole purpose is to ensure that content that has been licensed has delivered royalties that are identified and accounted for. The role can be taken by collective management organisations or by private companies on behalf of songwriters, composers, performers, music publishers, or record labels. [@iso_isbn_2017] |
| `original version` | The first established form of a work. [@iso_iswc_2022] |
| `composite of samples` | A composite work containing new material and one or more samples of pre-existing recorded works. [@iso_iswc_2022] |

## Identifiers

| Term | Description |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `ISNI` | The ISNI system uniquely identifies public identities across multiple fields of creative activity and provides a tool for disambiguating public identities that might otherwise be confused. |
| `ISRC` | The International Standard Recording Code (ISRC) is a standard identifying code that can be used to identify sound recordings and music video recordings so that each such recording can be referred to uniquely and unambiguously. |
| `ISMM` | The International standard music number (ISMN) was developed by, and for, the music publishing sector as a separate system to complement the International standard book number (ISBN). The existence of the ISMN as a separate identifier system makes it possible to identify printed and notated music as a distinct category of publication within the global supply chain and to develop trade directories and similar services for the specialized market for music publications. |
| `ISWC` | The purpose in creating an ISWC for musical works is to enable more efficient administration of rights to those works on a worldwide basis. The ISWC provides an efficient means of identifying musical works in computer databases and related documentation and for the exchange of information between rights societies, publishers, record companies and other interested parties on an international level. |
| `VIAF ID` | The VIAF (Virtual International Authority File) combines multiple name authority files into a single OCLC-hosted name authority service. |
